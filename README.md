This is my repository for storing tasks that were provided to me during the internship offered by CipherByte Technologies.

I developed a web-based To-Do List application to help users manage tasks efficiently. This website includes features like task creation, editing, categorization, due dates, and reminders. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This project improved my skills in front-end development and user experience design.
