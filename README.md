This is my repository for storing tasks that were provided to me during the internship offered by CipherByte Technologies.
<br>
I developed a web-based To-Do List application to help users manage tasks efficiently. This website includes features like task creation, editing, categorization, due dates, and reminders. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This project improved my skills in front-end development and user experience design. <br>
I  also developed WeatherVue, a weather application that provides real-time weather updates using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app displays current weather conditions, forecasts, and detailed information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WeatherVue offers a sleek, user-friendly interface and accurate data. This project enhanced my skills in API integration and frontend development.
